Steps:

A. Create a JSON Object const object = {a: 1, b: 2}. Access using object.a

1. npx create-react-app counter
2. cd counter/
3. npm start
4. create a class called Counter
5. explain what "class" means -> Like "classification" not "classroom"...Number, Array
6. create a default "state" property (with count=0)
7. explain what "state" is, this is how data is stored
8. display this.state.count, within the render function. The render function must return a single element
8. create a button
9. create a function "handleCount" which will be used as a callback - add console.log for testing -> show difference of "= () => {}" and "() {}" in regards to context
10. Add handleCount to button. This is the same as we pass in window.onload=init
11. When handleCount is called increment the state property "count"
12. Create component PageHeader, which displays the prop "count". We do this using "setState" which is an immutable operation
  a. Describe how imports work
  b. Explain that Ract has to be imported

13. Within App's render function also create a text box with the text label "What's your name?"
14. Create a callback function with App called handleNameChange, which will set state.name to the event.target.value value
15. Assign handleNameChange to the input's "onChange" event
16. Pass "state.name" to PageHeader as a "name" prop
17. Within PageHeader, add "Hello {props.name}. "
18. Within PageHeader, add "You are {props.count} years old :)"
